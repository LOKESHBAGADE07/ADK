# 🧠 Multi-Agent Orchestration Dashboard – AI-Powered Content Generation Suite

An interactive simulation of a multi-agent AI system for orchestrating end-to-end content strategy, generation, and optimization. The platform features four specialized agents—Strategy, Copywriting, Design, and Optimization—working together with real-time feedback, communication logs, and elegant animations.

## 🧩 Core Architecture

### 🧠 Agents & Workflow

The system simulates a coordinated pipeline of four AI agents:

1. **Strategy Agent** – Analyzes the market and formulates campaign goals  
2. **Copywriting Agent** – Writes headlines, slogans, and messages  
3. **Design Agent** – Proposes visual guidelines and brand elements  
4. **Optimization Agent** – Reviews outputs and suggests improvements  

Each agent performs tasks in a **realistic sequence**, with time-based transitions:

- `idle → thinking → working → completed`

### 🔄 Real-time Orchestration

- **Agent Cards**: Show current task, status, and output  
- **Workflow Graph**: Visualizes step-by-step flow  
- **Interaction Log**: Displays real-time inter-agent communication  
- **Progress Tracker**: Highlights overall campaign generation progress

## 🎨 UI/UX & Design System

- 🌈 **Modern color palette**:  
  - Primary Blue: `#3B82F6`  
  - Accent Purple: `#8B5CF6`  
  - Success Green: `#10B981`  
- 🖋️ **Typography**: Inter font family with clear hierarchy  
- 📐 **Layout**: Responsive grid optimized for mobile and desktop  
- ✨ **Animations**: Smooth transitions and feedback via Framer Motion  
- 🧩 **Agent visualization**: Animated cards, pulsing indicators, and active highlights

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### 🧠 State Management

- **React Hooks**: Handle dynamic agent state transitions  
- **Custom Hooks**: For timing simulations and inter-agent data flow  
- **Context API** (optional): Share state across dashboard components  

### 🎞️ Animation & Feedback

- **Framer Motion**:  
  - Progress bars animate in sync with agent phases  
  - Agent cards pulse and scale on activity  
  - Status indicators change color dynamically  

### ⏱️ Timing Simulation

| Phase       | Duration    |
|-------------|-------------|
| Thinking    | ~1s         |
| Working     | ~1.5s       |
| Completion  | Instantaneous output generation |

## 🧬 Agent Communication Logic

Simulated agent collaboration mimics real-world ADK coordination:

- 🧠 **Strategy → Copywriting**: Audience and channel goals  
- ✍️ **Copywriting → Design**: Messaging tone and content types  
- 🎨 **Design → Optimization**: Visual specs and theme consistency  
- 🔁 **Optimization → All**: Feedback loop for refinement
